Statistics guide
================

Zato's statistics can be divided into two parts:

* Data regarding how services perform, :ref:`documented below <stats-guide-service-statistics>`
* Load-balancer's statistics :doc:`documented in their own chapter <./lb>`

.. _stats-guide-service-statistics:

Service statistics
------------------

Each execution of any service prompts Zato to store certain statistics in the Redis
broker:

* Which service has been invoked and when it was
* How long it took for the service to complete
* :ref:`CID <progguide-write-service-cid>` the service has been invoked with

Zato's own 
`internal (look up stats_jobs) <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-server/src/zato/server/spring_context.py>`_
:doc:`scheduler's jobs <../progguide/scheduler>` aggregate raw information
into higher-order structures, all stored in Redis too - per minute stats are
converted into per hour status, these get aggregated into per day information and so
on until a summary information concerning each year has been constructed.

Note that the lowest level data that has been already aggregated is left in Redis and, unless it's 
needed, :doc:`must be cleaned up manually or using a custom job <./maintenance>`
in order to avoid an unnecessary growth of Redis.
