High-level overview
====================


The three-layer architecture
============================

In the classical three-layer architecture of fronted, middleware and backend
processes, Zato is best placed at the middle and the far backend of your IT
infrastructure.

Zato is best suited for business integration - such as implementing an Enterprise
Service Bus (ESB), or for core services - such as billing, customer management,
purchase processing, supporting marketing campaings, core banking and many
similar activities that form a backbone of an enterprise.

Zato can serve as either an ESB or an application server and a successful implementation
of a Zato environment allows for:

* aiding in introducing and optimizing complex business processes
* creating software solutions in less time
* connecting dispersed applications
* enabling the communication between systems with incompatible interfaces
* unifying access methods to independent applications
* introducing a common security model across different parts of the IT infrastructure

Message processing
==================

Consituting its very core, the Zato's excellect message processing capabilities allow you
to:

* create reusable services
* transform messages between different formats
* orchestrate the services of multiple autonomous systems
* send and receive messages across many transports available, using either
  synchronous or asynchronous methods
* log, audit and monitor messages flowing through using an advanced
  search engine
* validate the messages for accordance with business rules
* enrich the messages from different sources
* queue the messages if applications involved in integration scenarios run at
  different processing speeds
* implement services in less time using Python, a very high-level programming language
  that promotes the ease of use and development speed

Transports
==========

Various transports that Zato can access allow one for reaching out to any application,
regardless of its origin and programming language used. The transports include:

* the ubiquitous HTTP(S) protocol
* FTP(S)
* AMQP
* ActiveMQ
* WebSphere MQ
* ZeroMQ
* JMS
* Solr
* REST
* SOAP

Web admin
=========

Zato has a slick and powerful web admin application for administrator to manage
the environments. Web admin allow one to perform routine, planned as well as
ad hoc activities, such as deploying services, configuring security, access channels,
browsing the messages and more.

Zato, the open-source project
=============================

Zato is licensed under a commercial-friendly ZZZ license and is not only
software but also an open-source project promoting open collaboration through
peer production and unrestricted exchange of ideas between developers
and users. *Everyone* is strongly encouraged to take part in the project and
help build better world through nicer, faster, easier and more reliable software!
