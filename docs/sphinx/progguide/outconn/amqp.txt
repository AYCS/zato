AMQP outgoing connections
=========================

Overview
--------

Asynchronously sends a message to an AMQP queue specified in the 
:doc:`connection's details <TODO>`. Doesn't support publishing of messages to a topic.

The message is first published on the :doc:`Zato broker </architecture/redis>`
off of which the connector process responsible for communication with external
AMQP resources picks it up and actually sends it to the remote queue.
