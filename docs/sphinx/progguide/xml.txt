XML
===

Overview
--------

It's easiest to use :doc:`Simple IO (SIO) <./sio>` to accept or return XML
in your services but if that's not an option it's still very easy to use XML
directly. In fact, if you choose to use `lxml <http://lxml.de>`_, you won't even
have to manipulate XML as such at all - everything will be generated for you.

First, let's define a bare-bones service and an HTTP channel that will be used
throught the chapter. Save the following code in an xml_example.py file
and :doc:`hot-deploy <TODO>` it.

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           self.response.payload = '' # Return nothing for now
