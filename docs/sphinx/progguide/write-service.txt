Writing a service
=================

From a programmer's point of view, a service is a Python class that subclasses
zato.server.Service and implements a handle(self) method.

Below is the simplest possible Zato service meant to illustrate the point of how
little coding is needed to write services. Granted, it doesn't do much useful,
but still can be :doc:`hot-deployed <TODO>` and while it's not possible to
:doc:`invoke <TODO>`
it
:doc:`through <TODO>`
:doc:`channels <TODO>`
it's still a proper service.
