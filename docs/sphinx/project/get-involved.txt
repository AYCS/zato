Getting involved
================

Want to help? **Superb!**

* Programmers should famliarize themselves with 
  `the source code on GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/>`_.
  Fork and send patches at will! :-)

* Designers are always needed to help make 
  `the website <TODO>`_, 
  :doc:`documentation <../index>`
  and
  :doc:`Zato itself <TODO-link-to-web-admin>`
  even more prettier!
  
* Wanna send a quick documentation patch or suggestion? Just 
  `open a new ticket in GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/issues>`_
  
* Packagers are wanted to :doc:`help port Zato to more platforms <../admin/guide/install-zato>`

* Always feel welcome to spend time on `forums <TODO>`_ and `IRC <irc://irc.freenode.net/zato>`_
  if you'd like to help other community members out or just chat in general
  
And remember - Zato project is all about tolerance - make sure you always act
in accordance with our :doc:`diversity statement <./diversity>`.

Have fun and see you there!
