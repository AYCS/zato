Installing a server
===================

Steps
-----

* Make sure `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ is installed and allows for future Zato servers to connect,
  e.g. a user for Zato has been added
* :doc:`Install an ODB <./install-odb>`
* :doc:`Install a cluster's config <./install-cluster>`
* Prepare crypto material, in PEM, with no passwords, for the web admin to use:

  * Public key
  * Private key
  * Certificate
  * A list of CA certificates the server can trust
  
  Note that Zato ships with :doc:`a simple CA <../../cli/ca>` 
  that can be used on development environments.
  
* Issue the :doc:`zato create server <../../cli/create-server>` command
