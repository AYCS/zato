Installing and configuring Zato components
==========================================

Overview
--------

* Each Zato environment is comprised of one or more clusters
* Clusters store their configuration in an SQL ODB
* Each cluster has a load-balancer
* A web admin console is needed to manage a cluster however a single web admin instance can be used
  to administer more than one cluster
* Each cluster has zero or more servers
* Incoming and outgoing connections are handled by servers and certain types of
  protocols - AMQP, JMS WebSphere MQ and Zero MQ - require separate connector
  processes to handle the traffic. The connectors are started
  and managed automatically, they don't need manual configuration.

.. note ::

  Cluster is a logical being - its mere physical manifestation is that it has
  its own configuration in the ODB. However, servers, web-admin, load-balancer,
  connectors are all components that actually start operating system-level processes,
  write out log entries and otherwise behave like objects that need to be administered.

Creating a new environment
--------------------------

To set up a completely new Zato environment you need to:

* Make sure Redis is installed and configured to allow access for Zato
* Ensure an SQL database is installed and a schema/username for Zato is created.
  Supported databases are:

  * PostgreSQL 9.x
  * Oracle 11.2.x
  
* Make a new cluster by:

  * Using a :doc:`a quickstart cluster <../../cli/quickstart>`
  * Manually creating each of the components needed:
    
    * SQL ODB
    * Cluster's config
    * Web admin
    * Load-balancer
